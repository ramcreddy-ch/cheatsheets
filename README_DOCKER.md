Docker is a very popular tool introduced to make it easier for developers to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. A container is a utility provided by Docker to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run an application, such as libraries and other dependencies packed by the developer during the application’s packaging process. This assures developers that their application can be run on any other machine.
